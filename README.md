Java Programming Language Tests

## How to run:

Make sure javac and java are in the OS PATH, then enter into a sub-directory, eg:

```bash
cd HelloWorld
run
```

First command enters into `HelloWorld` folder and `run` is a simple MS-DOS Batch file which contains commands to clean/compile/run the files inside the directory.

## TODO:
The method used for building sub-projects is not ideal and using something like `Gradle` is a vital requirement.
